## Overview
this project helped me alot to have a quick revision for what i learned after two weeks of doing nothing
### The challenge
know more about the grid system
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### Useful resources

- [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/] - This helped me for learning the grid system. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp] - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand a lot of Javascript and jQuery. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
